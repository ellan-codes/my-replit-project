Role: Senior full-stack engineer. Goal: Fix our website’s contact form so submissions are emailed via SMTP using the custom domain hi.logichm.com, and delivered to ellangellpo@gmail.com. The site is hosted on Vercel.

Constraints / requirements:
- Do NOT hardcode secrets in code or commit them.
- Use environment variables (Vercel env vars) for SMTP credentials and destination email.
- Add server-side validation + basic spam protection (honeypot + rate limiting).
- Return a clear success/failure response to the frontend; show a friendly message to user.

Step 1 — Identify current form wiring
- Find the contact form component and how it currently submits (fetch to an API route? third-party?).
- If there is no backend handler, create one as a Vercel-friendly API endpoint (Next.js route handler /pages/api or /app/api depending on structure).

Step 2 — Implement email sending through hi.logichm.com
- Use Nodemailer (preferred) or another minimal SMTP library compatible with Vercel serverless.
- Configure SMTP using these env vars:
  - SMTP_HOST=hi.logichm.com
  - SMTP_PORT=587
  - SMTP_SECURE=false (STARTTLS)
  - SMTP_USER=<full email address used to authenticate, e.g. contact@hi.logichm.com or whatever mailbox exists>
  - SMTP_PASS=<APP_PASSWORD>
  - MAIL_TO=ellangellpo@gmail.com
  - MAIL_FROM="LOGIC HM Website <no-reply@hi.logichm.com>" (or use a real mailbox if needed)
- IMPORTANT: Set the message “from” so deliverability is reasonable:
  - Use `from: process.env.MAIL_FROM`
  - Use `replyTo: userProvidedEmail` so replies go to the submitter
  - Put user name/email/message in the body.

Step 3 — Frontend integration
- Ensure the form posts JSON to the API endpoint.
- Disable the submit button while sending; show success/error states.
- Clear the form on success.

Step 4 — Security + DX
- Validate required fields server-side (name/email/message).
- Add a honeypot input (e.g. `company` hidden field); reject if filled.
- Add lightweight rate limiting by IP (in-memory best-effort is fine for Vercel; if project already uses Upstash/Redis, use that).
- Log only non-sensitive info; never log SMTP_PASS.

Step 5 — Local + Vercel env var instructions
- Add a .env.example with the required variables (no secrets).
- Ensure the handler reads process.env.* and works in Vercel.
- Provide the exact file paths you changed and a short checklist to deploy.

Deliverables:
- The exact code changes (files + diffs or full updated files).
- The API endpoint URL path the form will call.
- A checklist for setting Vercel env vars + redeploying.
